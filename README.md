# Badcalc
This is a horrible little calculator that I am making in c++ with my questionable coding skills, all while teaching myself c++ at the same time. The goal of this project is not for the code to be well written or look nice, but a personal challenge for myself to make it in as few lines as possible. I might consider adding more features, but who knows I might just get bored of this little pet project of mine. This repository didn't start with the project, I just got bored on one rainy Thursday morning and decided to upload this joke of a calcuator to my github.
