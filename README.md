# Badcalc
This is a horrible little calculator that I am making in C++ with my questionable coding skills, all while teaching myself C++ at the same time. The goal of this project is not for the code to be well written or look nice, but a personal challenge to make a calculator from scratch while being new to programming and C++. Over time this calculator will likely get more and more functions added to it and hopefully I can eventually make this a well rounded calculator program.
## installation
This calculator is mostly meant to be used in a linux terminal, I just compile in using g++ while naming it badcalc useing the command: g++ badcalc.cpp -o badcalc. lastly you should use the dot slash command and then the name like this -> ./badcalc, and it works.
you should be able to compile it on windows or MacOS as well but I dont use either of those Operating systems so I an not quite sure how and I don't intend on learning how to so if you would like to use this calculator on any other Os as a novelty, your on your own here.
### to do
* eventually make a working gui
* add ability to just take an equation given by user input and answer it
* add ability to add, subtract, etc. more than just two term without requiring the user to input more than two terms
* add ability to directly take keycodes from the keyboard instead of having to type what you want to do and then pressing enter
* make sure that the code doesnt turn into a mess of spagetti code that is unreadable
* add more trig fnxs
