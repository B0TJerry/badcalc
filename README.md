# Badcalc
This is a horrible little calculator that I am making in C++ with my questionable coding skills, all while teaching myself c++ at the same time. The goal of this project is not for the code to be well written or look nice, but a personal challenge to make a calculator from scratch while being new to programming and C++. Over time this calculator will likely get more and more functions added to it and hopefully I can eventually make a well rounded calculator program.
## installation
This calculator is mostly meant to be used in a linux terminal, I just compile in using g++ while nameing it badcalc like this g++ badcalc.cpp -o badcalc, lastly I would just do ./badcalc and it somehow works.
As of making this work on anything except linux is far beyond me and my coding skills or willingness to do it
