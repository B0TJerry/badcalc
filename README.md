# Badcalc
This is a horrible little calculator that I am making in C++ with my questionable coding skills, all while teaching myself c++ at the same time. The goal of this project is not for the code to be well written or look nice, but a personal challenge to make a calculator from scratch while being new to programming and C++. I might consider adding more features, but who knows I might just get bored of this little pet project of mine. This repository didn't start with the project, I just got bored on one rainy Thursday morning and decided to upload this joke of a calcuator to my github.
installation
This calculator is mostly meant to be used in a linux terminal, I just compile in using g++ while nameing it badcalc like this g++ badcalc.cpp -o badcalc, lastly I would just do ./badcalc and it somehow works.
As of making this work on anything except linux is far beyond me and my coding skills or willingness to do it
